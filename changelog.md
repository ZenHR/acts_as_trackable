## Version: 0.4.5
  ### Patch

    - Housekeeping: Removed old gem files from version control.

## Version: 0.4.4
  ### Patch
    - Critical Fix: Properly cache `nil` when `object_activity` is preloaded but doesn't exist (old records).
    - Prevents N+1 queries when accessing `created_by`/`updated_by` on records without `object_activity`.
    - Previously, the fallback query would execute for each record even when using `includes(object_activity: [:created_by, :updated_by])`.
    - Now correctly returns `nil` without database queries when association is preloaded and empty.

## Version: 0.4.3
  ### Patch
    - Performance Fix: Fixed N+1 query issue when accessing `created_by` and `updated_by` after eager loading.

    - The `created_by` and `updated_by` methods now properly respect preloaded associations.
    - When using `includes(object_activity: [:created_by, :updated_by])` or `Preloader.new(records: records, associations: { object_activity: %i[created_by updated_by] })`, the methods now use the preloaded data instead of triggering additional database queries.

    - Added comprehensive test coverage for N+1 query prevention scenarios.
    - Migration Note: This is a non-breaking change. Existing code will continue to work, but performance will improve when using nested eager loading.
